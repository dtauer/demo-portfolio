# Demo Portfolio Website with GitHub Pages

This repo uses the final portfolio files from the Frontend Masters [Web Development Project: Personal Portfolio Website](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/portfolio-project) and deploys them using GitHub Pages.

I also recommend watching [Getting a Software Engineering Job, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/getting-a-job-v3) to learn more about GitHub Pages and how to craft a much better project README.
